This one is pretty lean. Simply navigate to the "dice6" folder and open "index.html" in a browser of your choice. To make the experience as immersive as it can possibly get, press F11 to make the browser full screen.

1. To begin your throw press any key.
2. To stop the throw, again press any key.
3. Read the number and play as usual on the board ;)
